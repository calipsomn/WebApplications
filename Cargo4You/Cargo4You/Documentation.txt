1.0 The Test
We would like to explore your practical software development skills in a short exercise.
The programming languages used in this test must include ASP.NET, C# and JavaScript. In conjunction with these, you may use any other languages, tools or libraries you want.
2.0 Requirements
A logistics company called Cargo4You specialises in shipping small to large packages across the world. They would like to offer an online tool to their customers to check the price of parcels 
before making orders. The price depends on the dimensions and weight of the package. They would also like to capture the customers’ input for future analysis.
Design and develop a web application that has the following minimum features:
1. A customer is able to input the dimensions of the package (width, height, depth) as well as the weight.
2. The price for shipping the package is calculated based on dimensions and weight. Calculations are based on the following logic:
a. Based on dimensions:
i. Any parcel <= 1000cm3 costs €10
ii. Any parcel > 1000cm3 and <= 2000cm3 costs €20
iii. Any parcel > 2000cm3 and <= 5000cm3 costs €50
iv. Any parcel > 5000cm3 costs €150
b. Based on weight:
i. Any parcel <= 2Kg costs €15
ii. Any parcel > 2Kg and <= 15Kg costs €18
iii. Any parcel > 15Kg and <= 25Kg costs €35
iv. Any parcel > 25Kg costs €45 plus €0.537 for every Kg over 25Kg
3. The final price for the package is the most expensive calculation based on dimensions and weight. For example, if based on dimensions the price is €20, and based on weight the price is €35, 
the final price is €35.
4. The details of the package is captured by the web application so it can be analysed at a later date.
5. The package price is displayed to the user. The user is then encouraged to make the order.
Above and beyond the basic requirements explained above, extra points will be given for overall quality including code clarity, maintainability, interactivity, UI, ease of use, security and creativity.
Good luck!
